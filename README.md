# J-RPG Game

Welcome to the J-RPG Game, a turn-based role-playing game (RPG) designed for two players. This project showcases an implementation of various object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C#, including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Players create teams of characters, each with unique abilities and stats, and battle until one team is victorious.


## Features

- Five unique character classes: Warrior, Mage, Paladin, Thief, and Priest.
- Skill-based combat: Each class has unique abilities and skills with cooldowns and mana costs.
- Turn-based gameplay: Players alternate turns choosing actions and targeting opponents.
- Configurable game settings: Adjust character stats and team size via a configuration menu.
- Detailed battle logs: See the results of each action during gameplay.


## Gameplay Overview

- Character Selection: Each player selects characters for their team, customizing their names and choosing from five predefined classes.
- Turn-Based Combat: Players take turns choosing skills and targets. Each action has consequences, such as dealing damage, buffing allies, or healing.
- Victory Conditions: The game ends when one team is entirely defeated.
